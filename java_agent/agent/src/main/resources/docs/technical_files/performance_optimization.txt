# Performance Optimization Tips

## Query Optimization
- Always use indexes on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.
- Avoid SELECT * – fetch only needed columns.
- Use EXPLAIN to analyze slow queries.

## Caching Frequent Data
Implement caching for data that rarely changes:
- Use Redis or Memcached for cache layer.
- Recommended TTL: 5–15 minutes for dynamic data, up to 1 hour for semi-static.
- Invalidate cache on relevant events (e.g., after update via webhook).

## Pagination and Lazy Loading
Never load large datasets at once:
- Implement cursor-based or offset/limit pagination.
- Load related data only when user expands (lazy loading).
- Default page size: 20–50 items.

## Frontend Tips
- Enable gzip/brotli compression on your server.
- Use CDN for static assets.
- Minify JavaScript and CSS bundles.
