# Troubleshooting: Login and Authentication Issues

## Common Error: "Invalid credentials"
This error occurs when the provided email or password does not match our records.
- Double-check for typos in your email address.
- Passwords are case-sensitive – ensure Caps Lock is off.
- Try resetting your password using the "Forgot password?" link.

## Common Error: "Account locked"
Your account will be temporarily locked after 5 consecutive failed login attempts for security reasons.
- Wait 30 minutes – the lock will be automatically removed.
- If you need immediate access, contact support@company.com with your account email.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Problems
If you enabled 2FA but don't receive the code:
- Check if the phone number or authenticator app is correctly configured in Settings > Security.
- Try resending the code (up to 3 times).
- As a last resort, use one of your backup recovery codes.

## Session Expired
If you see "Session expired – please log in again":
- This happens after 24 hours of inactivity or when logging in from a new device.
- Simply log in again – no data will be lost.
