# Database Connection Troubleshooting

## Connection Timeout
Error message usually contains "Connection timed out" or "Failed to connect within timeout".

Solutions:
- Increase connection timeout in your connection string:
  jdbc:mysql://host:3306/dbname?connectTimeout=30000&socketTimeout=30000
- Check if the database host is reachable (ping / telnet port 3306).
- Verify firewall rules allow outbound traffic on the database port.

## SSL/TLS Errors
Common errors: "SSL connection error", "Unable to establish SSL connection".

Quick fix for development only:
Add to connection URL:
?useSSL=true&trustServerCertificate=true

For production:
- Import the database server's certificate into your Java truststore.
- Or use ?verifyServerCertificate=true with proper CA.

## Too Many Connections
Error: "Too many connections"

Causes and fixes:
- Close connections properly in your code (use try-with-resources).
- Configure connection pooling (HikariCP recommended) with reasonable max pool size.
- Contact support to increase the global connection limit if needed.
