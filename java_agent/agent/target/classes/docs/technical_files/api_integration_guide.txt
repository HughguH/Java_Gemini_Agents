# API Integration Guide

## Setting Up Webhooks
Webhooks allow real-time notifications about events in your account.

Supported events:
- user.created
- subscription.updated
- payment.succeeded
- payment.failed
- invoice.paid

Requirements:
- Your endpoint must be publicly accessible via HTTPS.
- Respond with HTTP 200 within 5 seconds.
- Verify signatures using the secret key found in Dashboard > Webhooks.

Example verification header:
Authorization: Bearer whsec_your_webhook_secret

## Authentication
All API requests must include an API key:
Header: Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key

API keys can be created and revoked in Dashboard > Developers > API Keys.
Never expose secret keys in client-side code.

## Rate Limits
- 1000 requests per hour per API key.
- On exceeding the limit, API returns 429 Too Many Requests.
- Respect the Retry-After header for automatic recovery.
